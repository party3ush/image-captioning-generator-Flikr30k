**Image Captioning using Flickr30k Dataset - GitHub README**


## Overview

This repository contains the code implementation for image captioning using the Flickr30k dataset. The model is built using deep learning techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. The model has achieved an accuracy of 42% on the Flickr30k test set.

## Dataset

The Flickr30k dataset is a widely used benchmark for image captioning tasks. It contains 30,000 images, each paired with five human-generated captions. The images cover a diverse range of topics and scenes, making it an ideal dataset for training and evaluating image captioning models.

To access the Flickr30k dataset, you can visit [link to dataset](https://link.to.dataset) and follow the instructions to download it.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Pandas

You can install the dependencies using `pip` by running:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python pandas
```

## Model Architecture

The image captioning model is based on the popular encoder-decoder architecture. It utilizes a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract image features (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) and feeds them into an attention-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) decoder. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant image regions while generating captions, resulting in more accurate and contextually rich descriptions.

## Usage

1. Download the Flickr30k dataset and preprocess the data:

```
# Instructions to download the dataset can be found in the Dataset section.
# Preprocess the dataset to create training and validation sets.
python preprocess.py
```

2. Train the image captioning model:

```
python train.py
```

3. Evaluate the model:

```
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

Our trained image captioning model achieves an accuracy of 42% on the Flickr30k test set. This performance may vary depending on the model architecture, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques used. You can experiment with different approaches to improve the captioning performance further.
